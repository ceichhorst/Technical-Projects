## Project Overview

The original website lacked visual hierarchy and accessibility consideration. My redesign focused on improving:

- **Content clarity and organization**
- **Accessibility** (color contrast, screen reader support, semantic HTML)
- **User flow** for key tasks like renting a garden plot and gardening tips

## Key Improvements

- **Navigation**: simplified and restructured for better discoverability of content
- **Content hierarchy**: User clear headings and sections to guide users through the site
- **Typography and color**: Improved legibility and color contrast for accessibility
- **Alt text and ARIA roles**: Enhanced screen read support

## Tools & Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Figma (for wireframes and mockups)
- Chrome DevTools (for accessibility testing)
- WCAG Guidelines (for accessibility improvements)
